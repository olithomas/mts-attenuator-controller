# mts-attenuator-controller
A script to control the MTS System Technik SCF-0300 Digital Variable Attenuator (http://www.mts-systemtechnik.de/index.php/mts_en/Products/Devices-Systems/Standard-Coupling-Units/SCF-0300-SCF-0301-LAN-Standard-Coupling-Field). The script allows the dynamic ramping up and down of attenuation values on all channels independently and simultaneously, which enables the the user to perform simulations of movement through radio environments

The MTS System Technik Digital Variable Attenuator is a 6-channel digitally controlled variable attenuator that can set RF sttenuation values of betweenm 0 and 93 dB for channels from 400MHz to 2900MHz.
The LAN version of the attenuato comes fitted with an 'X-Port' Serial-over-LAN interface, which implements the simple serial protocol over TCP sockets. This allows control of the attenuator via a standard IP network.
